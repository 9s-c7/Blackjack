# Blackjack
This is fun cards game called Blackjack. It's made using HTML,CSS,Bootstrap and Javacript.

Blackjack is also called twenty-one and pontoon.The goal is to get a total card value of 21 or to come closer to it, without going over, than the dealer, against whom all betting is done.

Here the dealer will be the computer.

If any of the players go above 21,the score card says "BUST!" and that player loses the game.

The player gets to choose the cars by prssing the "HIT" button, which plays a _swoosh_ sound as the cards appear.Once the player is satisfied with their score, they can stand their score against the dealer. The dealer (a bit here) then plays his cards and whoever has the higher score (but less than or equal to 21 ) wins.If the score is equal, then it is a draw.

Upon winning , a _kaching_ sound is played, while on losing an _aww_ sound is played.The overall number of wins and losses are kept tracked of in a table.

All the face cards have a value of 10 , Ace has a value of 1.
